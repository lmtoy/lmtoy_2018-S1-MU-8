# 2018-S1-MU-8

This project observed NGC5194 (M51) in CO and HCN. It was published in
arXiv
(accepted for publication in ApJ on April 15, 2022)

The data produced in the paper were processed with the very first "unnamed" version
of the pipeline: lmtoy_reduce.sh and lmtoy_combine.sh.

NOTE: A few obsnums are in 2018S1-MU-8 - this is unusual, but we have to deal with it.


## Running the pipeline

There are two ways to run the pipeline, both using the $WORK_LMT directory where the root
of the data is.

1. Use the WORK_LMT that came with where **lmtoy** was installed. This will likely require
   permission from the owner

2. Set WORK_LMT to a directory here in this directory,  something like

              WORK_LMT=`pwd`

      do_MU-8p - for the record, this is the original script that was used for testing
